          <p className="font-sm">
            I felt in love with the web at 13 years old and at some point it
            wasn’t enough to just browse websites, I had to learn how to design
            and develop them. Then I realized that the web will always be
            evolving and no matter how good I became, there will always be new
            stuff to learn and processes to improve.
          </p>

              {" "}
              If I work with you, you can expect me to always be pushing new
              technologies, practices, or ways of work, always with the vision
              of learning from others, collaborate and help to improve the
              workflow and culture of the team.

          <p className="font-sm">
            My scope of work starts with design ideation and branding and ends
            with front-end code so I usually work as a link between teams, I can
            be your ninja designer, manage a design team, do front-end
            development or a mix between all of them.
          </p>
          <p className="font-sm">
            My experience involves being the design and front-end director for a
            Mexican startup called EasyBroker for 5 years, designing a CRM (Web
            and App) from scratch and doing daily improvements to the product.
            And for the past year and a half, I have worked for two SF-based
            startups, improving my English and remote-working skills. In the
            meantime, I have also worked as a freelance learning all the perks
            of pitching ideas, communication, writing/verbal skills and
            organization of my workflow.
          </p>
          <p className="font-sm">
            I&apos;m currently looking for a fresh start. I want to contribute
            to an idea that I believe in, building a great product and getting
